                                <p>A private mortgage advisor accompanies and represents the property owners while keeping their best interests. Most people do not have enough knowledge about the mortgage, therefore they may find themselves committed to a deal that will affect their quality life and they may even pay more than they really need too. </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The bank is a financial corporation that sells money and wants to maximize its profits, but at the same time it is also a corporation that manages risks. A mortgage is a product from a range of products that the bank sells, and as a corporation that sells a product, it is reasonable to assume that the Bank wants to make a profit and maximize its income within the framework of borrowers' ability to meet their obligations. On the one hand, the bank wants to maximize his profits by adapting the tracks of the mortgage exactly according to what is cheaper and suitable for him at that time. On the other hand, the bank wants to make sure that the borrowers can repay the monthly payments without complications and to avoid failing to comply with future obligations for the full term of the mortgage.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>As a result of the various interests, caution must be exercised and a mortgage advisor must be taken who knows the professional language used by the bank and the significance of each individual in the process in order to promote the client's goals in the best possible way. The mortgage is the most important deal that will affect our quality of life for a long time and therefore it is important to know the market and consult with reliable and professional entities before closing the deal.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The Mortgage Advisor has the knowledge and the tools to deal with the Bank and to conduct exhaustive negotiations until the customer will get the best and most economical mortgage conditions made to suit the customer's abilities, needs and desires and save tens to hundreds of thousands of shekels in the transaction..</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>In a custom mortgage I will take care of Your interests,</strong> I will make the process efficient, simple, and will give you tranquility and peace of mind, along with professionalism, transparency and availability, accompanying every step with the bank, with comprehensive accompaniment and professional solutions in a professional manner and keeping discretion, with the emphasis being that you return a minimum amount of money to the bank, save time and unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>

                                <p>Want to buy a house? Going to make one of the most important transactions in your life?</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>There are a few things you need to know about taking a mortgage.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Mortgage is the longest, largest and most complex loan you will take, but at the same time it is considered one of the best financing tools that exist, and it is important to execute it correctly with objective professional advice and advice.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Everyone (almost) needs a mortgage. Everyone have needs, desires and financial abilities.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>It's important to ask: Are you going to live in the apartment? Or is it for investment?</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Why do I ask? Because it really matters. Choosing the mortgage is directly affected by your needs and needs to match your<strong> personal financial profile! </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Choosing the mortgage mix is made of a number of parameters, before we have even dealt with interest rates.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>I do not mean to say that interest rates are not important –<strong> they are very important</strong>, but only after assembling the most suitable routes suited<strong> for each one! </strong> There are a variety of routes and each track has different interests, advantages and disadvantages. This is a complex process, in a big deal.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Assembling the tracks by professional advice and guidance is the best and most accurate manner for each customer, and can lead to substantial savings, as much as tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of shekels in the transaction.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Beyond the substantial savings, another thing that is no less important in assembling the mortgage, in the best and most qualitative way, is to understand that a mortgage has a long-term impact on your life, and therefore it is important that the house's regular management will continue to exist properly, When the emphasis<strong> is to return a minimum amount of money to the bank! </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>To your question: Why me? Since I am of vital importance as a registered consultant in the Mortgage Advisors Association in your most important transaction. I will accompany you, hand in hand, until you sign your agreement with the bank with a personal, courteous, professional and quality service. </strong> I have an MBA in finance and human resources. I work with the most advanced and up-to-date software and simulators. Beyond this, you must understand, that there is a <strong>conflict of interest </strong>between the client and the bank. The Bank is a financial institution, whose goal is to maximize its profits, while the borrower wishes to pay as little as possible and minimize their costs. I base myself on my experience as someone with professional and managerial experience of 12 years of banking seniority.</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>There is regulation on the banks, subjected to Bank of Israel guidelines. The Bank of Israel is the one that updates, inter alia, directives regarding mortgages. Such as: shareholders' equity, repayment ratio, entitlements, etc. For this reason, it is important to understand that when we are interested in taking out a mortgage, we must prepare for several main parameters that the Bank examines:</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>We require<strong> at least 25% equity. </strong> In other words, if the value of the property is 1 million NIS, we should have at least 250,000 NIS. It is important to know that the higher the percentage of bank financing, the higher the interest rates are, but if the percentage of financing requested by the bank is lower, the interest rates will be lower. It should be noted that if the percentage of financing that the borrowers have is low, it is worthwhile, before signing the purchase contract, to request approval in principle from the bank. </p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>When purchasing a new apartment from the contractor</strong>, check whether there is a lending bank for the project. The bank will transfer money to the contractor only after paying the shareholders' equity. Only after payment of shareholders' equity will the bank pay the contractor payments in accordance with the purchase contract. It is important to know - the amounts for financing will be determined according to the assessment of the Bank only. In other words, the percentage of financing will be according to <strong>the value determined by the appraiser </strong>and not to the amount appearing in the purchase contract.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>The monthly payment</strong> of the mortgage should not exceed 35% of the net disposable income. (Net income since the banks deduct from the balance of income expenses such as: loans / alimony, etc.). The repayment ratio is 30% to 40% at most (this is a variable that may change in different banks). </p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It is important to know</strong> - a low monthly repayment does not necessarily indicate a mortgage built professionally and properly for the borrower. In most cases, a very low return indicates that the repayment is expected to rise significantly in the future and will also affect the customer's repayment ability in the future, and sometimes even lead to a substantial risk of non-payment. It is also important to understand that the shorter the period, the lower interest rates will be. What is most important is that the mortgage mix will be professionally assembled and customized according to the client's needs.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>It is important to ensure that the <strong>financial conduct</strong> is correct and the credit history of the borrowers is not marked or has alerts.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The Bank is examining the<strong> employment continuity </strong>of the borrowers. Examines the repayment ability of the borrower to ensure that they can meet payments over time, since the mortgage is a long-term loan.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Therefore, the Bank requests all the relevant documents before submitting the papers and obtaining the approval in principle. There is a difference in submitting a salaried worker’s portfolio to a self-employee’s portfolio. The Bank requests for the first meeting your ID number, current account transactions for the last 3 months, details of loans and 3 salary slips and / or tax assessments for the self-employed.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It's important to know</strong> - you should not go to a bank without a registered private consultant like you do not do a real estate transaction without an attorney. The process of taking a mortgage is complex, both procedurally and in terms of choosing the right mix. The assumption is that there is a conflict of interest between the bank and the borrower. The bank has an interest in making as much money as possible and it is important to pay as little money as possible and select the best routes that are <strong>available for you personally! </strong></p>

                                <p>The refinancing process<strong> means taking a new mortgage, with better terms, than your existing mortgage. </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Usually this is done when the interest rates are lower than at the time of taking the mortgage. The process of refinancing can save tens of thousands and up to hundreds of thousands of shekels. The new mortgage agreement must be examined, and make sure that it is <strong>tailored to the customer's </strong>,financial profile, A few things can be considered, one is shortening the period, increasing the monthly payment or reducing the monthly payment, all according to the level of the customer's income and the personal needs of each one.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>In the refinancing process, it is possible to examine the increase in the value of the asset and the addition of a sum to the mortgage according to the customer's needs. </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>There is a wide range of activities that can be carried out in the mortgage cycle, taking care of the customer's personal interest and improving the standard of living and the economy of their home. An important detail to be addressed is the early repayment commission and to then examine the profitability of refinancing in a variety of courses. <strong> Usually, the higher the repayment commission, the higher the savings, because in this situation there is a bigger difference in the interest rates in the customer's benefit</strong> (between the mortgage taken and the interest rates that exist during the refinancing process).</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>You want to repay the mortgage but do not know what commission you will have to pay on early repayment? Let me put it in order and help you understand how you can try to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>
                                <br />
                                <pThe mortgage is usually composed of several different tracks and each track has a repayment commission calculated differently.></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>1.<strong> <u> Operating commission: </u></strong> a fee that the Bank charges for operating a refund, and amounts to tens of shekels (about 60 NIS).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>2. <strong> <u>Non-notification fee: </u></strong> The bank asks the borrower for a notice of at least 10 days prior to repayment of the mortgage. If the borrower will update 10 days in advance, he will not pay a commission, but if he does not notify, he will be charged 0.1% of the amount of the mortgage paid.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>3. <strong> <u> Capitalization commission: </u></strong> (the most significant commission) When we took the loan from the bank, the bank undertook a certain interest at <strong>fixed interest</strong> (no matter whether it is a fixed interest rates / non-fixed interest / linked or unlinked interest every 5 years or more) Now to repay the loan, the bank will have to find a new borrower for the money, but if the interest rate at early redemption is <strong>lower</strong>, it means that the bank will <strong>benefit less</strong> and therefore demands <strong>to compensate itself for the difference. </strong> Because of these, we have committed ourselves to the bank, to pay a certain interest rate throughout the entire mortgage period, and at the time of early repayment we terminate the liability in the middle of the year.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>If so, how do you calculate the commission? </strong> When a customer wishes to make early repayment, the bank examines the average interest prevailing at that time in the market on the same loan track (for the remaining period). At the same time, it examines the average interest rate on the same track at the time of taking the loan, or the interest set for the customer - the lower of the two. After the examination, the <strong>Bank examines the difference between them: </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>If the current interest rate on the loan is low </strong>or equal to the interest at the time of taking the loan then the client <strong>will be charged a capitalization fee. </strong>If the interest rate is<strong> higher </strong>the client <strong>will not be charged</strong> for the difference.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><u>For example </u>, if you took a 20-year mortgage at a 6% interest rate, which was the average interest rate in the market at the time. After 5 years you asked to refinance the mortgage and make an early repayment. The Bank will examine the average interest on a similar loan for 15 years, to the amount remaining. If the average interest rate stands at 7% for example, the bank will not charge you commission, since the interest rate is higher and the bank can lend your money to someone else without losing. On the other hand, if the interest rate is 4%, the bank will charge you a capitalization commission of 2%.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><u>Another example </u> is that at the exit points defined in the tracks already in advance (for example, every 5 years), we will not pay a capitalization fee at the point of departure (after 5 years), but if we decide to repay the mortgage before the exit point, (For example, if we decide after 3 years to it pay off, we will pay only for the remaining two years to the point of departure). Of course, all this assuming that the interest rate is lower than what we took the mortgage - as I explained in the calculation of the capitalization fee shown above.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>Important highlights: </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>In the tracks on a variable basis for a<strong> short period</strong> (such as prime, variable each year, foreign currency) <strong>there is no capitalization fee </strong>because we have pledged that the interest paid will change according to <strong>the interest rate changes in the economy. </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Eligibility loans do not have capitalization fees because this is a benefit from the state.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>4. <strong>Average index fee (index-linked loans only): </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>In the average index fee</strong>, in the case in which an index-linked loan is repaid <strong>between the 1st of the month and the 15th of the month. </strong> Since the index is published on the 15th of each month, in a loan that was repaid in the previous days, the interest rate<strong> is actually unknown. </strong> Accordingly, <strong> the Bank charges a commission at the rate of 50% of the average increase of the previous 12 months </strong> (i.e., the borrower will pay half of the average index of the last 12 months). If it turns out that the index for that month was negative, stood at zero, or even positive, but less than the average calculated as the commission, <strong> then the customer actually paid a kind of fine. </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>On the other hand, if you repay the mortgage<strong> between the 16th and the end of the month</strong> you will not <strong>pay a commission</strong>, but you have to take into account that on the 15th of that month<strong> the published index will be calculated on the mortgage. </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It's important to know</strong> - if you expect <strong>the index to be high</strong> in the month you<strong> return the mortgage then return it before the 15th</strong>, because you will pay only the average index of last year. But if you think<strong> the index will be negative or low wait after the 16th of the month. </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>5. <strong> Exchange rate differentials on foreign currency linked loans: (common loans) </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>An additional commission is collected in the event that a foreign currency-linked loan is taken. The commission is the amount of exchange rate differentials between the foreign exchange rate on the day on which the early repayment was made and the rate that will occur two business days later <strong>If the borrower gives written notice of at least two business days Early</strong>, he is exempt from this commission.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The specialization is to build<strong> a tailor-made mortgage</strong>, according to the client’s needs, and to build an optimal mix that will be composed, inter alia, of tracks with no early repayment fees.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>I will accompany you hand in hand and formulate the best way for you with comprehensive financial support, professionally and with professional solutions that will give you peace of mind and confidence in the transaction. </strong></p>

                                <p>Mortgage transfer is done when we buy a new property and sell an old one, and the terms in the current mortgage, of the old property, are with excellent conditions. In the act of transferring, we want the mortgage on the old house to be transferred to the new property and the terms of the mortgage to remain the same. Most of us will need to add money to buy the new property. (If the value of the new apartment is lower than the old property, we will need to get permission from the bank to do a transfer, because the value for collateral isn’t as good for the bank).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It's important to know</strong> – mortgage transfer can increase your monthly payments, despite the conditions listed. That is not a problem, if your payment ability allows this, but if that is a problem, then the bank might not approve the transfer process and you will have to take a new mortgage for the full amount.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Another important thing to consider is that the bank, in which you are doing the transfer, can take advantage of the situation and will take its time and might not give you good interest rates on the additional amount that you need to add to the mortgage (which does not include the transferred funds). Therefore, if the offer you receive is not an attractive one, it is recommended to check an alternative offer, at another bank for the full amount (the transferred mortgage + the addition you need for the new property). </p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>The transfer process can be done in 2 ways, </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>If you already purchased</strong> an apartment then the bank transfers the mortgage to the new property and makes sure to update the collaterals accordingly.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>If you have not yet purchased</strong> a new property but have already sold the old house then the bank transfers the mortgage into a bank guarantee, and the buyer of your old property deposits the money in favor of the guarantee in your bank and not directly for you. The payment for the mortgage will continue, and when you buy the new property, the bank will transfer the money from the guarantee to your seller and mortgage the new property.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>I will make sure you get the best mortgage, suited for you, and I will accompany you, hand in hand, right until the final signing in the bank, with a personal, courteous and professional service.

                                <br />
                                <p><strong>When people ask me what is a good mortgage? I usually answer: a custom-tailored mortgage, because everyone has their own personal house! </strong></p>

                                <p>When we take a mortgage from the bank, we are required to make two types of insurance: life insurance and structural insurance.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>Structural insurance</strong> is actually insurance of the apartment. When buying this insurance through the bank, it should be noted that the building insurance <strong>does not include a third party</strong> (third-party apartment insurance is designed to protect you from damage caused in various cases, such as dampness in the walls of the neighbor that comes from your bathroom or someone who has slipped on the stairs in your house).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>Life insurance </strong>is intended in case of inability to repay as a result of a death. The insurance company will pay the mortgage in case of death.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It is important to know</strong> - when buying the insurance from a bank, you should get another offer from an external insurance agent and make sure that it includes the maximum coverage.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>I will make sure you get the best mortgage, suited for you, and I will accompany you, hand in hand, right until the final signing in the bank, with a personal, courteous and professional service. I will refer you to a professional insurance agent who will take care of you, and offer an attractive and worthwhile offer. </strong></p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>Many people do not know about the existence of the construction inputs index. After we understand what the construction inputs index is and to whom it relates, we will examine whether it really constitutes a significant threat in the differences when signing the contract and the actual payment to the contractor.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The construction inputs index measures how much it costs to building, and then determines the basket price. It measures the changes in the expenses that are required to purchase materials, products, etc., which are used to build residential buildings, and represents the composition of construction expenses of the contractors. This index is published and calculated every 15th of the month. The current basket price, relative to the price of the previous basket, reflects the increase in the index in percentages relative to the previous month.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The construction inputs index refers mainly to apartment purchasers from the contractor. These purchasers pay the cost of the apartment in installments (as appears in the purchase contract), and these payments are linked to the construction inputs index. This index has a huge impact on purchasers of new apartments and payments to the contractor may change scientifically, with amounts that were probably not taken into account before the acquisition.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>That is why homebuyers should follow this measure to understand how much their debt has increased and to calculate whether they should pay the contractor early or delay payment as much as possible. Whether to advance the mortgage, or save in the meantime each month and transfer higher equity to the contractor? The question arises which is higher? Construction Input Index or Interest on the Mortgage? The purpose of buying the property is also significant when examining the feasibility of advancing or postponing payments to the contractor.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It is important to know</strong> that the construction inputs index is more expensive than the consumer price index. Try to ask the contractor for linkage to the consumer price index and not to the construction inputs index. This index also expresses the costs of the contractor. The construction inputs index does not reflect the costs of the land and the profit of the developer, but only the construction costs, but despite everything, the index is also calculated on them. There is a gap we are paying for, and unfortunately, the issue is still unresolved.</p>

                               <p>Purchase tax applies to the buyer and is paid for when purchasing an apartment. Purchase tax does not apply to profits and is paid to the tax authority when purchasing a real estate asset. The tax is paid on the investment itself, in accordance with the purchase tax brackets (as opposed to the betterment tax that applies to the seller when the asset is sold and calculated by an assessor).</p>
                               <br />
                               <p>The tax authorities understand that sometimes, before the buyer sells the previous apartment, he buys a new apartment, and then there is a certain period that he owns two apartments. This is a short term that constitutes an intermediate term until the sale date, and therefore the tax authorities exempt the buyer from purchase tax on the apartment if he sells the apartment within a year.</p>
                               <br />
                               <p>Purchase tax is paid according to the tax brackets. The higher the purchase transaction, the higher the tax and its rate. The purchase tax method allows for payment according to the scope of the transaction, so that in transactions for the purchase of apartments in a low volume, the purchase tax, respectively, is low and in many cases, there is no purchase tax.</p>
                               <br />
                               <p>Everyone pays purchase tax but if you buy a first apartment, or if you improve housing and sell the previous apartment within two years then the tax will be reduced relative to second / third apartment buyers and so on.</p>

                                <br />
                                <p>The mortgage is for borrowers aged 60 to 94. You ask how it is possible? In all banks, the age limit for a mortgage amounts to 75 (80 if I exaggerate)</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>So, what is the logic and how does it happen? </strong></p>
                                <br />
                                <p>It is very important to understand that a reverse mortgage is for the precious golden age who are interested in removing an existing mortgage / helping children / repaying loans / moving to protected housing / renovations, etc. (If I simplify it, then I mean the loan is for any purpose at large sums of money).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>In this mortgage, the percentage of financing is determined according to the age of the borrowers and the asset must be in the name of the borrowers who live in the property. This loan does not check for income but only the property's condition. The loan is not conditional upon the purchase of life insurance and is subject to the approval of the financing body.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The loan is repayable in two ways: a balloon loan until the last of the spouses passes away, or a monthly payment of interest only linked to the CPI and monthly management fees. There is no repayment commission on the loan.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>When the last borrower passes away, the heirs undertake, within one year, to repay the loan by taking a mortgage on the property or alternatively to sell the property and share the rest of the sale money after payment of the debt to the financing body.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>It is important to understand that the very fact that you own an asset that can be mortgaged constitutes sufficient security for the lender to provide you with a loan for your personal needs.</p>

                                <p>How to take a mortgage on apartments for the price of occupant price plan? Should the value of the apartment be taken into consideration, as written in the contract?</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Apartment purchasers receive a maximum of 75% financing / mortgage, while purchasers of apartments in the occupant price plan will benefit from significant financing rates, and this is not a trivial matter. These buyers have a double benefit because, beyond buying cheaper apartments, they do not have to pay high equity as other buyers need, when buying apartments.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>In many cases, they will be required to own equity of only 100 thousand nis, and the percentage of financing that they will be able to receive will amount to 85% to 90% of the market value, i.e., the assessor's valuation value (and not as recorded in the purchase contract as mentioned above).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The high rates of financing are provided because buying at a price per occupant program is not the actual price / market price of an apartment for that area. On the face of it, the price per occupant program has very low rates of financing, but in relation to the real price of the apartment, it may be significantly lower. The Finance Ministry and the Bank of Israel have determined that it is not possible to approve 100% financing from the value of the property in the occupant price plan (although the percentage of financing is still very high and theoretically not far from that).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>Important information to know </strong>– The things that banks find important for securing the loan, is the real value of the property (as estimated appraiser) and not how much the apartment was bought for, under the purchase contract.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The conditions for obtaining a mortgage for the occupant are identical to the process of receiving a "regular" mortgage, and the purchasers must meet the usual mortgage checks of the banks.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>You should contact the bank branches that know the area, otherwise it will be difficult to receive the mortgage money. Moreover, there should be no difference in interest rates for apartment buyers at the of occupant plan.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It is important</strong> to consider purchasing an apartment at a price of occupant plan as a regular real- estate purchase. A couple who have won the raffle, will wait about 5 years before entering the apartment, so it is recommended to calculate the cost of the rent plus the cost of the property and examine the feasibility of the transaction. It is not clear which apartment the winners of the raffle will receive and whether it suits their personal needs, you will know the size of the apartment, what floor it is on, etc. after you are invited to a personal meeting to choose an apartment and sign the contract, there were quite a few people who had to give up the winning and decided not to buy the apartment because the remaining apartments did not meet their needs or did not match the budget.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>When people ask me what is a good mortgage? I usually answer: a custom-tailored mortgage, because everyone has their own personal house! </strong></p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>Have you decided to build your dream house? Congratulations!</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Self-construction involves many uncertainties, and many decisions must be made, including dealing with bureaucracy and professionals. In order for the dream not to become a nightmare, it is important that you prepare correctly and carry out preliminary planning that will include unexpected expenses and enable you to make an efficient and correct financial decision. The difficulty with self-constructed is the ability to anticipate the amount that is required to pay in total. Estimating the costs will help determine the scope of the construction and the level of finishes to the house.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Prepare a plan that will be as close to reality as possible and that way the surprises in the continuation of construction will be minor. Prepare a plan that includes<strong> the cost of land</strong>, when buying land from the Israel Land Administration you will have to add the cost of land development, <strong>the construction cost</strong> (the cost of sq. meter X number of built square meter), <strong> and additional costs</strong> such as: purchase tax, betterment tax, fees for attorney, real-estate brokerage fees, financing costs, linking costs to the consumer price index or to the construction inputs index, delays in the timetables, fees and forms, the cost of construction supervisor, engineer, fees for architects and other professionals; the contents of the building: furniture, kitchen and sanitary equipment, etc.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>In addition, there are one-time payments when buying the mortgage, such as appraisals, registration of collateral, fees for the bank, fees for a mortgage advisor, and if there are any irregularities in the budget, they affect the amount of the mortgage and the monthly repayment.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>When purchasing the land</strong>, you are not required to present any building plans or permits to the bank, and the money will be paid directly to the contractor in one run. <strong>During the construction</strong> phase you will be required to present detailed plans for the house, contractor plans, construction supervisor, etc., and the funds will be transferred to your account gradually. The mortgage money will be released gradually according to the progress of the construction, according to an engineer's approval or up to the current amount approved by the Bank for self-construction.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>It is important to know: </strong> In a mortgage for self-construction it is always advisable to ask for a higher amount of the initially planned amount, so that you can use it if you have exceeded the budget. You will not pay for the entire approved framework, but only for the amount you took. The Bank will usually approve up to 75% financing for the purchase of the plot and up to 60% mortgage for construction, in order to minimize risks if you exceed the budget. The bank will always prefer to stay with a safety margin. The Bank is not obliged to approve, but usually will prefer to approve additional financing in order to have an asset in his favor, in respect of the credit.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Self-construction requires you to deal with high costs in the early stages and invest a lot of time and resources, but eventually you will get a home that is perfectly suited to your unique needs and live your dream.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><strong>I will get you the best conditions, at each step, to realize your dream! </strong></p>
                                <br />

                                <p>Tama 38 is a national master plan for strengthening existing buildings against earthquakes, it was prepared at the initiative of the National Planning and Building Council, due to the location of the State of Israel on the Syrian-African Rift Line, which is at high risk of earthquakes.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The purpose of the plan is to provide an economic incentive to strengthen buildings (built before 1980) by granting increased building rights and shortening the bureaucratic procedures for obtaining building permits without the need to prepare a detailed plan, thereby encouraging homeowners to strengthen the structures they own.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>This means strengthening the existing building and adding up to two floors (usually a regular floor and another floor for a penthouse or two roof apartments with an exit to the roof). In return, the tenants receive an additional room in the form of a security room and an elevator (buildings that have been allowed to be built after this date are subject to reinforcement instructions only without additional building rights).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>As part of this project (TAMA 38/1), tenants enjoy many advantages, this is an original and quick way to improve the value of the property at no cost to the tenants, and all the expenses related to the execution of the project are paid by the developer. (Tama 38/ 2) the owner of the existing apartment receives a rent refund for the construction period until occupancy in the new apartment.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Despite the high importance of the project, TAMA 38 was implemented in a small way, mainly due to the entrepreneur's financing difficulties, and the construction of the buildings is subject to building rights on the roofs of the buildings. The project turned out to be complex, because the roofs cannot be mortgaged and if the entrepreneur enters difficulties and becomes insolvent, the project will not succeed and the bank will have no collateral to realize. (These are construction rights and not rights to the land itself, and therefore there is difficulty in providing collateral to the bank as a condition for financing the project).</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>This is a project that requires real professionalization in the field and it is very important to consult with the right professionals.</p>
                                <br />

                                <p>A purchasing group is a group of individuals that together form a "partnership agreement" in order to purchase land and build a residential building on it, in order to reduce costs. A purchasing group can organize itself or through a management company that organizes all the stages of purchase and construction. The Group enables its members to reduce the brokerage gaps in purchasing the property as a finished product. On the other hand, the risk of participation in initiating the project is usually greater than the risk of buying one of the apartments, and the final price is not guaranteed. As stated, a purchasing group is an entrepreneurial entity in all respects, with all the risks and complications involved in real estate ventures.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Bank financing and a credit framework for the project as a whole are required, and each member of the group is examined individually to obtain approval from the lending bank. A member who has all the shareholders' equity required for the transaction must also open a credit facility at the lending bank. This is a safety net that will not create financing problems during the project.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The mortgage money of the members of the purchasing group is paid to the contractors and the professionals, according to the pace of the construction progress. The Bank treats each customer as a project entrepreneur and therefore the financing costs are high relative to a private person who takes out a mortgage.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>The group locates the land, recruits the potential buyers, receives bids from the contractors and the professionals, and conducts them. The selection of professionals is very significant in a project of this type, and their choice should not be taken lightly. The cooperation between the parties is critical and decisive, and this is a complex process that requires in-depth financial planning from the beginning of the project.</p>
